"description": "Mural by Moises of Toronto. While it might cover three stories of parking garage, you might miss this one if you don't look up! Back into the parking spaces behind Lagos Grill and look up at the east-facing wall of the Park Street Parking Garage. This mural was painted as part of the 2023 Free For All Walls mural festival.", "image": "/photos/w791.png"}
