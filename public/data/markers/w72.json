"description": "Alley House by Kill Joy of Houston. This one is hard to miss - it's an entire house! Best reached by the alley that runs between Victoria Avenue and Pelissier Street. Head north up the alley where it intersects with Wyandotte Street West. This mural was painted as part of the 2023 Free For All Walls mural festival.", "image": "/photos/w721.png"}
